Refine the provided passages with a focus on the key elements that directly answer the question. Your summary should aim to be about one-third the length of the original passages, but not less than 100 words. Adhere to these guidelines:
1. **Directly Address the Question**: Extract and emphasize information that directly answers the question. The final answer, under five words, must be identifiable in your summary.
2. **Structured Bullet-Point Format**: Present key information in a structured, bullet-point format. Each bullet point should correspond to a specific element or piece of evidence related to the question. This will aid in clarity and ease of understanding.
3. **Preserve Critical Details**: While summarizing, ensure that crucial information and terms, especially those that contribute to the EM score, are retained without alteration.
4. **Eliminate Redundant or Irrelevant Information**: Remove any content that does not contribute to answering the question, thus reducing the length of the text and focusing on relevant details.
5. **Coherent and Concise Summary**: The summary should be coherent, linking bullet points logically. Aim for a balance between brevity and comprehensive coverage of the necessary details.
6. **Continuous Improvement Based on Performance Data**: Regularly analyze the performance of this summarization approach, particularly the EM rates, and refine it accordingly to enhance effectiveness.
The goal is to provide a clear, concise, and relevant summary that maximizes EM retention, aiding the reader in quickly identifying the precise answer.''',
    "v8": '''###Instruction###Focus on condensing the provided passages to highlight the key elements that directly answer the question. Keep these guidelines in mind while summarizing:
1. **Concentrate on Exact Match (EM) Retention**: Prioritize the preservation of exact phrases and terms from the original text that are crucial for the question. This is essential for maximizing the EM rate.
2. **Structured and Concise Summary**: Aim for a summary that is about a third of the original passages' length, with a minimum of 100 words. Present the information in a clear, bullet-point format, focusing on different key elements or evidence related to the question.
3. **Eliminate Extraneous Information**: Carefully remove content that doesn't contribute to answering the question. This will help in reducing the length of the text while maintaining focus on relevant details.
4. **Ensure Coherence and Clarity**: While being concise, the summary should be coherent and easily understandable. Arrange the bullet points in a logical sequence that guides the reader to the answer.
5. **Continuous Improvement and Adjustment**: Regularly review and adjust your summarization technique based on its performance, particularly the EM and F1 scores, to enhance its effectiveness.
Remember, the objective is to provide a summary that is both concise and rich in crucial details, aiding in the quick identification of the precise answer.''',
'v9':'''###Instruction###
Create a summary of the provided passages with a sharp focus on the most relevant information that directly answers the question. Follow these revised guidelines to enhance precision and clarity:
1. **Zero in on Direct Answers**: Scrutinize the passages to identify the exact phrases and terms that directly respond to the question. Make sure these elements are central in your summary.
2. **Depth in Relevant Summarization**: Give a detailed summary for the passages that contain direct answers to the question. Summarize less relevant passages more briefly. Aim for the summary to be one-third the length of the original text, but ensure it is at least 100 words.
3. **Enhanced Structured Format**: Use a clear, structured format such as bullet points, ensuring each point succinctly encapsulates a direct piece of evidence or a key term related to the question.
4. **Rigorous Exclusion of Irrelevancies**: Actively remove any part of the text that doesnâ€™t contribute to directly answering the question. This includes redundant phrases or loosely related information.
5. **Strengthen Logical Progression**: Organize the summary so that it logically leads the reader to the answer, with a clear and coherent structure that connects the bullet points or paragraphs.
6. **Direct and Unambiguous Language**: Employ straightforward and unambiguous language. Avoid any form of abstraction or generalization. Stick to the specific details and terms that are necessary for the answer.
7. **Review for Precision and Completeness**: After summarizing, review the content to ensure that it precisely captures the essential information from the original text and is complete in its coverage of these details.
The objective is to produce a summary that is not only precise in capturing the exact answer but is also comprehensive and clear, effectively guiding the reader to understand and identify the specific answer.
